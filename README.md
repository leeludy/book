# Books Project

### What ?

_Have you ever stopped in front of the streets libraries to rummage for your next book?_
_Did you ever wonder what happened to the books you placed in there?_
_Maybe they got on a plane, maybe they got adopted after being read and read again._

_This curiosity is what inspired this project._
_A simple QR code system allows users to follow their books and participate in tracing their history without storing personal data or creating an account._
